    "# Example 2: GLM estimation in a block design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Natural Scenes Dataset localizer experiment, subj01, runs 01-04\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "##### GLMsingle is new tool that provides efficient, scalable, and accurate single-trial fMRI response estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Example 2 notebook is to guide the user through basic calls to GLMsingle, using a representative, small-scale test dataset (in this case, 4 runs from an fMRI localizer session containing a block design, which was part of the Natural Scenes Dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to examine the effect of GLMsingle on the reliability of fMRI response estimates to the different conditions used in the localizer set (e.g. faces, bodies, objects, scenes, words). By default, the tool implements a set of optimizations that improve upon generic GLM approaches by: (1) identifying an optimal hemodynamic response function (HRF) at each voxel, (2) deriving a set of useful GLM nuisance regressors via \"GLMdenoise\" and picking an optimal number to include in the final GLM, and (3) applying a custom amount of ridge regularization at each voxel using an efficient technique called \"fracridge\". The output of GLMsingle are GLM betas reflecting the estimated percent signal change in each voxel in response to each experimental stimulus or condition being modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond directly improving the reliability of neural responses to repeated conditions, these optimized techniques for signal estimation can have a range of desirable downstream effects such as: improving cross-subject representational similarity within and between datasets; improving the single-image decodability of evoked neural patterns via MVPA; and, decreasing the correlation in spatial patterns observed at neighboring timepoints in analysis of fMRI GLM outputs. See our video presentation at V-VSS 2020 for a summary of these phenomena as observed in recent massive-scale fMRI datasets (the Natural Scenes Dataset and BOLD5000): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb3Nn7Han8o\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2 contains a full walkthrough of the process of loading an example dataset and design matrix, estimating neural responses using GLMsingle, estimating the reliability of responses at each voxel, and comparing those achieved via GLMsingle to those achieved using a baseline GLM.** After loading and visualizing formatted fMRI time-series and their corresponding design matrices, we will describe the default behavior of GLMsingle and show how to modify hyperparameters if the user desires. Throughout the notebook we will highlight important metrics and outputs using figures, print statements, and comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users encountering bugs, unexpected outputs, or other issues regarding GLMsingle shouldn't hesitate to raise an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/kendrickkay/GLMsingle/issues\n"
