    "---------------------\n",

    "##### GLMsingle is new tool that provides efficient, scalable, and accurate single-trial fMRI response estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Example 1 notebook is to guide the user through basic\n",
    "calls to GLMsingle, using a representative, small-scale test dataset (in\n",
    "this case, an example session from a rapid event-related visual fMRI\n",
    "dataset - the Natural Scenes Dataset core experiment).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to examine the effect of GLMsingle on the reliability of\n",
    "single-trial fMRI response estimates. By default, the tool implements a\n",
    "set of optimizations that improve upon generic GLM approaches by: (1)\n",
    "identifying an optimal hemodynamic response function (HRF) at each voxel,\n",
    "(2) deriving a set of useful GLM nuisance regressors via \"GLMdenoise\" and\n",
    "picking an optimal number to include in the final GLM, and (3) applying a\n",
    "custom amount of ridge regularization at each voxel using an efficient\n",
    "technique called \"fracridge\". The output of GLMsingle are GLM betas\n",
    "reflecting the estimated percent signal change in each voxel in response\n",
    "to each experimental stimulus or condition being modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond directly improving the reliability of neural responses to repeated\n",
    "stimuli, these optimized techniques for signal estimation can have a\n",
    "range of desirable downstream effects such as: improving cross-subject\n",
    "representational similarity within and between datasets; improving the\n",
    "single-image decodability of evoked neural patterns via MVPA; and,\n",
    "decreasing the correlation in spatial patterns observed at neighboring\n",
    "timepoints in analysis of fMRI GLM outputs. See our video presentation at\n",
    "V-VSS 2020 for a summary of these phenomena as observed in recent\n",
    "massive-scale fMRI datasets (the Natural Scenes Dataset and BOLD5000):\n",

    "**Example 1 contains a full walkthrough of the process of loading an\n",
    "example dataset and design matrix, estimating neural responses using\n",
    "GLMsingle, estimating the reliability of responses at each voxel, and\n",
    "comparing those achieved via GLMsingle to those achieved using a baseline\n",
    "GLM.** After loading and visualizing formatted fMRI time-series and their\n",
    "corresponding design matrices, we will describe the default behavior of\n",
    "GLMsingle and show how to modify hyperparameters if the user desires.\n",
