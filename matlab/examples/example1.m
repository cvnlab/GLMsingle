%% Example 1 Overview
%
% GLMsingle is new tool that provides efficient, scalable, and accurate
% single-trial fMRI response estimates.
%
% For a complete description of GLMsingle, please refer to our manuscript 
% published in eLife: https://elifesciences.org/articles/77599
%
% The purpose of this Example 1 notebook is to guide the user through basic
% calls to GLMsingle, using a representative, small-scale test dataset (in
% this case, an example session from a rapid event-related visual fMRI
% dataset - the Natural Scenes Dataset core experiment).
%
% The goal is to examine the effect of GLMsingle on the reliability of
% single-trial fMRI response estimates. By default, the tool implements a
% set of optimizations that improve upon generic GLM approaches by: (1)
% identifying an optimal hemodynamic response function (HRF) at each voxel,
% (2) deriving a set of useful GLM nuisance regressors via "GLMdenoise" and
% picking an optimal number to include in the final GLM, and (3) applying a
% custom amount of ridge regularization at each voxel using an efficient
% technique called "fracridge". The output of GLMsingle are GLM betas
% reflecting the estimated percent signal change in each voxel in response
% to each experimental stimulus or condition being modeled.
%
% Beyond directly improving the reliability of neural responses to repeated
% stimuli, these optimized techniques for signal estimation can have a
% range of desirable downstream effects such as: improving cross-subject
% representational similarity within and between datasets; improving the
% single-image decodability of evoked neural patterns via MVPA; and,
% decreasing the correlation in spatial patterns observed at neighboring
% timepoints in analysis of fMRI GLM outputs. See our video presentation at
% V-VSS 2020 for a summary of these phenomena as observed in recent
% massive-scale fMRI datasets (the Natural Scenes Dataset and BOLD5000):
% https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb3Nn7Han8o
%
% Example 1 contains a full walkthrough of the process of loading an
% example dataset and design matrix, estimating neural responses using
% GLMsingle, estimating the reliability of responses at each voxel, and
% comparing those achieved via GLMsingle to those achieved using a baseline
% GLM. After loading and visualizing formatted fMRI time-series and their
% corresponding design matrices, we will describe the default behavior of
% GLMsingle and show how to modify hyperparameters if the user desires.
% Throughout the notebook we will highlight important metrics and outputs
% using figures, print statements, and comments.
%
% Users encountering bugs, unexpected outputs, or other issues regarding
% GLMsingle shouldn't hesitate to raise an issue on GitHub:

%
% In this NSD scan session, there are a total of 750 trials, in which a

% more than once.) In the design matrix shown, there are 583 predictor
% columns/conditions, one per distinct image. Notice that white rectangles
% are pseudo randomized and they indicate when the presentation of each
% image occurs. Note that in some runs not all images are shown; if a
% column does not have a white rectangle it means that this image is shown
% in a different run within the session.

%% Call GLMestimatesingletrial with default parameters

% Outputs and figures will be stored in a folder (you can specify its name
% as the 5th input to GLMestimatesingletrial). Model estimates can be also
% saved to the 'results' variable which is the only output of
% GLMestimatesingletrial.

% Optional parameters below can be assigned to a structure, i.e., opt =
% struct('wantlibrary',1,'wantglmdenoise',1); Options are the 6th input to
% GLMestimatesingletrial.

% There are many options that can be specified; here, we comment on the
% main options that one might want to modify/set. Defaults for the options
% are indicated below.

% wantlibrary = 1 -> Fit HRF to each voxel 
% wantglmdenoise = 1 -> Use GLMdenoise 
% wantfracridge = 1  -> Use ridge regression to improve beta estimates
% chunknum = 50000 -> is the number of voxels that we will
%     process at the same time. For setups with lower memory, you may need to 
%     decrease this number.

% wantmemoryoutputs is a logical vector [A B C D] indicating which of the
%     four model types to return in the output <results>. The user must be
%     careful with this, as large datasets can require a lot of RAM. If you
%     do not request the various model types, they will be cleared from
%     memory (but still potentially saved to disk). Default: [0 0 0 1]
%     which means return only the final type-D model.

% wantfileoutputs is a logical vector [A B C D] indicating which of the
%     four model types to save to disk (assuming that they are computed). A
%     = 0/1 for saving the results of the ONOFF model, B = 0/1 for saving
%     the results of the FITHRF model, C = 0/1 for saving the results of the
%     FITHRF_GLMdenoise model, D = 0/1 for saving the results of the
%     FITHRF_GLMdenoise_RR model. Default: [1 1 1 1] which means save all
%     computed results to disk.

% numpcstotry (optional) is a non-negative integer indicating the maximum
%     number of GLMdenoise PCs to enter into the model. Default: 10.

% fracs (optional) is a vector of fractions that are greater than 0
%     and less than or equal to 1. We automatically sort in descending
%     order and ensure the fractions are unique. These fractions indicate
%     the regularization levels to evaluate using fractional ridge
%     regression (fracridge) and cross-validation. Default:
%     fliplr(.05:.05:1). A special case is when <fracs> is specified as a
%     single scalar value. In this case, cross-validation is NOT performed
%     for the type-D model, and we instead blindly use the supplied
%     fractional value for the type-D model.

% For the purpose of this example, we will keep all outputs in the memory.
opt = struct('wantmemoryoutputs',[1 1 1 1]);

% This example saves output .mat files to the folder
% "example1outputs/GLMsingle". If these outputs don't already exist, we
% will perform the time-consuming call to GLMestimatesingletrial.m;
% otherwise, we will just load from disk.

%% Summary of important outputs

% The outputs of GLMestimatesingletrial.m are formally documented in its
% header. Here, we highlight a few of the more important outputs:
%
% R2 -> is model accuracy expressed in terms of R^2 (percentage).
%
% modelmd -> is the full set of single-trial beta weights (X x Y x Z x
% TRIALS). Beta weights are arranged in chronological order.
%
% HRFindex -> is the 1-index of the best fit HRF. HRFs can be recovered
% with getcanonicalHRFlibrary(stimdur,tr)
%
% FRACvalue -> is the fractional ridge regression regularization level
% chosen for each voxel. Values closer to 1 mean less regularization.

%% Plot a slice of brain showing GLMsingle outputs

%% Run a baseline GLM to compare with GLMsingle

% Additionally, for comparison purposes we are going to run a standard GLM

opt.wantlibrary = 0; % switch off HRF fitting

opt.wantmemoryoutputs = [0 1 0 0];

% If these outputs don't already exist, we will perform the call to
% GLMestimatesingletrial.m; otherwise, we will just load from disk.
if ~exist(fullfile(outputdir, 'GLMbaseline', 'TYPEB_FITHRF.mat'),'file')
    
    [ASSUME_HRF] = GLMestimatesingletrial(design,data,stimdur,tr,[outputdir '/GLMbaseline'],opt);
    models.ASSUME_HRF = ASSUME_HRF{2};
    
else
    
    % Note that even though we are loading TYPEB_FITHRF betas, HRF fitting
    % has been turned off and this struct field will thus contain the
    % outputs of a GLM fit using the canonical HRF.
    results = load([outputdir '/GLMbaseline/TYPEB_FITHRF.mat']);
    models.ASSUME_HRF = results;
    
end

% We assign outputs from GLMestimatesingletrial to "models" structure.
% Again, results{1} contains GLM estimates from an ONOFF model so we are
% not going to extract it.

%%

% Now, the "models" variable holds solutions for 4 GLM models
disp(fieldnames(models))

%% Get indices of repeated conditions to use for reliability calculations

% To compare the results of different GLMs we are going to calculate the
% voxel-wise split-half reliablity for each model. Reliability values
% reflect a correlation between beta weights for repeated presentations of
% the same conditions. In short, we are going to check how
% reliable/reproducible the single trial responses are to repeated
% conditions estimated with each GLM type.

% This NSD scan session has a large number of images that are just shown
% once during the session, some images that are shown twice, and a few that
% are shown three times. In the code below, we locate the
% indices in the beta weight GLMsingle outputs modelmd(x,y,z,trials) that
% correspond to repeated images. Here we only consider stimuli that have
% been presented at least twice. For the purpose of the example we ignore
% the 3rd repetition of the stimulus.

% Consolidate design matrices
designALL = cat(1,design{:});

% Construct a vector containing 1-indexed condition numbers in
% chronological order.

corder = [];
for p=1:size(designALL,1)
    if any(designALL(p,:))
        corder = [corder find(designALL(p,:))];
    end
end

%%

% Let's take a look at the first few entries
corder(1:3)

% Note that [375 497 8] means that the first stimulus trial involved
% presentation of the 375th condition, the second stimulus trial involved
% presentation of the 497th condition, and so on.

%%

% In order to compute split-half reliability, we have to do some indexing.
% we want to find images with least two repetitions and then prepare a
% useful matrix of indices that refer to when these occur.
repindices = [];  % 2 x images containing stimulus trial indices.

% The first row refers to the first presentation; the second row refers to
% the second presentation.
for p=1:size(designALL,2)  % loop over every condition
    temp = find(corder==p);
    if length(temp) >= 2
        repindices = cat(2,repindices,[temp(1); temp(2)]);  % note that for images with 3 presentations, we are simply ignoring the third trial
    end
end

% Let's take a look at a few entries
repindices(:,1:3)

% Notice that the first condition is presented on the 217th stimulus trial
% and the 486th stimulus trial, the second condition is presented on the
% 218th and 621st stimulus trials, and so on.

fprintf('There are %i repeated images in the experiment \n',length(repindices))

% Now, for each voxel we are going to correlate beta weights describing the
% response to images presented for the first time with beta weights
% describing the response from the repetition of the same image. With 136
% repeated conditions, the correlation for each voxel will reflect the
% relationship between two vectors with 136 beta weights each.

%% Compute median split-half reliability for each GLM version

% Finally, let's compute split-half reliability. We are going to loop
% through our 4 models and calculate split-half reliability for each of
% them.

% We first arrange models from least to most sophisticated (for
% visualization purposes)
model_names = fieldnames(models);
model_names = model_names([4 1 2 3]);

% Create output variable for reliability values
vox_reliabilities = cell(1,length(models));

% For each GLM...
for m = 1 : length(model_names)
    
    % Get the GLM betas
    betas = models.(model_names{m}).modelmd(:,:,:,repindices);  % use indexing to pull out the trials we want
    betas_reshaped = reshape(betas,size(betas,1),size(betas,2),size(betas,3),2,[]);  % reshape to X x Y x Z x 2 x CONDITIONS
    
    % compute reliabilities using an efficient (vectorized) utility
    % function
    vox_reliabilities{m} = calccorrelation(betas_reshaped(:,:,:,1,:),betas_reshaped(:,:,:,2,:),5);
    
    % Note that calccorrelation.m is a utility function that computes
    % correlations in a vectorized fashion (for optimal speed).
