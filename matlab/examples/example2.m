%% Example 2 Overview
%
% GLMsingle is new tool that provides efficient, scalable, and accurate
% single-trial fMRI response estimates.
%
% For a complete description of GLMsingle, please refer to our manuscript 
% published in eLife: https://elifesciences.org/articles/77599
%
% The purpose of this Example 2 notebook is to guide the user through basic
% calls to GLMsingle, using a representative, small-scale test dataset (in
% this case, 4 runs from an fMRI localizer session containing a block
% design, which was part of the Natural Scenes Dataset).
%
% The goal is to examine the effect of GLMsingle on the reliability of
% fMRI response estimates to the different conditions used in the localizer set 
% (e.g. faces, bodies, objects, scenes, words). By default, the tool implements a
% set of optimizations that improve upon generic GLM approaches by: (1)
% identifying an optimal hemodynamic response function (HRF) at each voxel,
% (2) deriving a set of useful GLM nuisance regressors via "GLMdenoise" and
% picking an optimal number to include in the final GLM, and (3) applying a
% custom amount of ridge regularization at each voxel using an efficient
% technique called "fracridge". The output of GLMsingle are GLM betas
% reflecting the estimated percent signal change in each voxel in response
% to each experimental stimulus or condition being modeled.
%
% Beyond directly improving the reliability of neural responses to repeated
% conditions, these optimized techniques for signal estimation can have a
% range of desirable downstream effects such as: improving cross-subject
% representational similarity within and between datasets; improving the
% single-image decodability of evoked neural patterns via MVPA; and,
% decreasing the correlation in spatial patterns observed at neighboring
% timepoints in analysis of fMRI GLM outputs. See our video presentation at
% V-VSS 2020 for a summary of these phenomena as observed in recent
% massive-scale fMRI datasets (the Natural Scenes Dataset and BOLD5000): 
% https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb3Nn7Han8o
%
% Example 2 contains a full walkthrough of the process of loading an
% example dataset and design matrix, estimating neural responses using
% GLMsingle, estimating the reliability of responses at each voxel, and
% comparing those achieved via GLMsingle to those achieved using a baseline
% GLM. After loading and visualizing formatted fMRI time-series and their
% corresponding design matrices, we will describe the default behavior of
% GLMsingle and show how to modify hyperparameters if the user desires.
% Throughout the notebook we will highlight important metrics and outputs
% using figures, print statements, and comments.
%
% Users encountering bugs, unexpected outputs, or other issues regarding
% GLMsingle shouldn't hesitate to raise an issue on GitHub:

%% Call GLMestimatesingletrial with default parameters

% Outputs and figures will be stored in a folder (you can specify its name
% as the 5th input to GLMestimatesingletrial). Model estimates can be also
% saved to the 'results' variable which is the only output of
% GLMestimatesingletrial.

% Optional parameters below can be assigned to a structure, i.e., opt =
% struct('wantlibrary',1,'wantglmdenoise',1); Options are the 6th input to
% GLMestimatesingletrial.

% There are many options that can be specified; here, we comment on the
% main options that one might want to modify/set. Defaults for the options
% are indicated below.

% wantlibrary = 1 -> Fit HRF to each voxel wantglmdenoise = 1 -> Use
% GLMdenoise wantfracridge = 1  -> Use ridge regression to improve beta
% estimates chunknum = 50000 -> is the number of voxels that we will
% process at the
%   same time. For setups with lower memory, you may need to decrease this
%   number.

% wantmemoryoutputs is a logical vector [A B C D] indicating which of the
%     four model types to return in the output <results>. The user must be
%     careful with this, as large datasets can require a lot of RAM. If you
%     do not request the various model types, they will be cleared from
%     memory (but still potentially saved to disk). Default: [0 0 0 1]
%     which means return only the final type-D model.

% wantfileoutputs is a logical vector [A B C D] indicating which of the
%     four model types to save to disk (assuming that they are computed). A
%     = 0/1 for saving the results of the ONOFF model B = 0/1 for saving
%     the results of the FITHRF model C = 0/1 for saving the results of the
%     FITHRF_GLMdenoise model D = 0/1 for saving the results of the
%     FITHRF_GLMdenoise_RR model Default: [1 1 1 1] which means save all
%     computed results to disk.

% numpcstotry (optional) is a non-negative integer indicating the maximum
%     number of PCs to enter into the model. Default: 10.

% fracs (optional) is a vector of fractions that are greater than 0
%     and less than or equal to 1. We automatically sort in descending
%     order and ensure the fractions are unique. These fractions indicate
%     the regularization levels to evaluate using fractional ridge
%     regression (fracridge) and cross-validation. Default:
%     fliplr(.05:.05:1). A special case is when <fracs> is specified as a
%     single scalar value. In this case, cross-validation is NOT performed
%     for the type-D model, and we instead blindly use the supplied
%     fractional value for the type-D model.

% For the purpose of this example we will keep all outputs in the memory.
opt = struct('wantmemoryoutputs',[1 1 1 1]);

% This example saves output .mat files to the folder
% "example2outputs/GLMsingle". If these outputs don't already exist, we

%
% modelmd -> is the full set of single-trial beta weights (X x Y x Z x
% TRIALS). Beta weights are arranged in chronological order.
%
% HRFindex -> is the 1-index of the best fit HRF. HRFs can be recovered
% with getcanonicalHRFlibrary(stimdur,tr)
%
% FRACvalue -> is the fractional ridge regression regularization level
% chosen for each voxel. Values closer to 1 mean less regularization.

% Now, "models" variable holds solutions for 4 GLM models
disp(fieldnames(models))

%% Organize GLM outputs to enable calculation of voxel reliability

% To compare the results of different GLMs we are going to calculate the
% voxel-wise split-half reliablity for each model. Reliability values
% reflect a correlation between beta weights for repeated presentations of
% the same conditions. In short, we are going to check how
% reliable/reproducible are the single trial responses to repeated
% conditions estimated with each GLM type.

% This NSD floc scan session has 6 repetitions of each condition per run.
% In the code below, we are attempting to locate the indices in the beta
% weight GLMsingle outputs modelmd(x,y,z,trials) that correspond to
% repeated conditions.

% Consolidate design matrices
designALL = cat(1,design{:});

% Construct a vector containing 1-indexed condition numbers in
% chronological order.

corder = [];
for p=1:size(designALL,1)
    if any(designALL(p,:))
        corder = [corder find(designALL(p,:))];
    end
end

%%

% let's take a look at the first few entries
corder(1:3)

% Note that [10 8 7] means that the first stimulus block involved
% presentation of the 10th condition, the second stimulus block involved
% presentation of the 8th condition, and so on.

%%

% In order to compute split-half reliability, we have to do some indexing.
% We want to find all repetitions of the same condition. For example we can
% look up when during the 4 blocks image 1 was repeated. Each condition
% should be repeated exactly 24 times.

fprintf('Condition 1 was repeated %i times across 4 runs, with GLMsingle betas at the following indices:\n',length(find(corder==1)));
find(corder==1)

% Now, for each voxel we are going to correlate beta weights describing the
% response to averaged even presentations of the 10 conditions with beta
% weights describing the responses from the averaged odd repetitions of the
% same conditions, over time. With 10 conditions in the localizer set, the
% split-half correlation for each voxel will thus reflect the relationship
% between two vectors with 10 beta weights each.

%% Compute median split-half reliability for each GLM version

% To calculate the split-half reliability we are going to average the odd
% and even beta weights extracted from the same condition and calculate the
% correlation coefficent between these values. We do this for each voxel
% inside the primary visual cortex and face-selective cortical ROIs.

% Notice that there is systematic increase in reliability moving from the
% first to the second to the third to the final fourth version of the GLM
% results, within both the early visual and face-selective ROIs. These
% increases reflect, respectively, the addition of HRF fitting, the
% derivation and use of data-driven nuisance regressors, and the use of
% ridge regression as a way to regularize the instability of closely spaced
% experimental trials. Depending on one's experimental goals, it is
% possible with setting of option flags to activate a subset of these
% analysis features.
% 
% Also, keep in mind that in the above figure, we are simply showing the
% median as a metric of the central tendency (you may want to peruse
% individual voxels in scatter plots, for example).
% 
% Note also that median reliability is consistently higher in the FFA ROI
% than in the V1 ROI in this analysis of localizer data. Importantly, this
% does not imply that V1 data are inherently noisy or unreliable across the
% NSD dataset (e.g. in the NSD core experiment). Here we are analyzing GLM
% outputs from the localizer dataset, which was designed to identify neural
% ROIs whose voxel tuning profiles vary meaningfully across a small,
% curated set of high-level stimulus categories. As such, we would expect
% the FFA voxels to have relatively more well-defined tuning curves, with
% more substantial variability in GLM betas between the localizer
% categories, than the V1 voxels, whose tuning is determined by lower-level
% image features that do not necessarily vary in systematic ways between
% the localizer categories. For these reasons, one might expect that
% split-half correlations would be somewhat lower in the V1 voxels using
% our particular metric of reliability (odd-even correlation) in this
% dataset. Different metrics of reliability may generate different patterns
% of results when comparing these two ROIs, and we would also expect
% results to vary depending on the stimulus set.
